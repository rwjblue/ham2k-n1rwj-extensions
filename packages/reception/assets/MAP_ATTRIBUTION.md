# Bundled map data and geometry

The extension bundles coarse country geometry, simplified state/province
boundaries, and country label positions; drawing or reopening its map never
downloads image tiles. The map is a reception diagram, not a navigation map.
Station positions come from each extension's feed adapter. RBN uses the
[RBN node directory](https://www.reversebeacon.net/nodes/) with Vail ReRBN's
registered-grid fallback; PSK Reporter reports carry sender and receiver grids.
The PSK preview does not yet connect to that feed. Positions are approximate.
Lines indicate reported reception, not a measured coverage boundary.

The source file `packages/reception/src/map/earth-110m.json` contains the 177 country geometries in
[`@d3-maps/atlas@1.0.0/world/countries/countries-110m`](https://esm.sh/@d3-maps/atlas@1.0.0/world/countries/countries-110m),
derived from Natural Earth at 1:110 million scale. TopoJSON arcs were expanded into
GeoJSON rings, country metadata removed, and longitude/latitude values rounded to
three decimals. No points were otherwise simplified. This keeps the full world
data small enough to include directly in the `.h2kext` JavaScript bundle.

The source files `packages/reception/src/map/admin1-boundaries.json` and
`packages/reception/src/map/geographic-labels.json` derive directly from the Natural Earth repository's
**v5.1.2** snapshot:

- [10m internal administrative boundary lines](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/v5.1.2/geojson/ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces_lines.geojson)
  cover most countries worldwide. Connected segments are joined at degree-two
  endpoints while preserving junctions, simplified with Douglas–Peucker at a
  longitude/latitude tolerance of 0.1 degrees, then rounded to two decimal places.
  Duplicate consecutive coordinates and lines that collapse to a point are
  removed. All source scale ranks are included: 8,991 output lines and 28,276
  coordinates. Minified GeoJSON is 412,556 bytes, or approximately 119 KB with gzip.
- [110m countries](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/v5.1.2/geojson/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson)
  supply 177 label candidates from `LABEL_X`, `LABEL_Y`, and `LABELRANK`.
  Labels use `NAME_LONG` when at most 20 characters, otherwise `NAME`.
  Coordinates are rounded to two decimals. The renderer chooses a sparse,
  non-overlapping subset; these are geographic labels, not receiver locations.

To reproduce these two files from the repository root, run
`mise run rbn:geography`, then `mise run format`. The generator pins the source tag
and verifies SHA-256 checksums before generating either file. It uses Node's
built-in modules and does not add a runtime dependency. The source checksums are:

The [Natural Earth admin-1 dataset](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/)
omits some tiny countries and disputed areas. It uses Natural Earth's standard
de facto boundaries. Its 10m source is simplified for this regional reception map;
it is neither a detailed local basemap nor an authoritative boundary reference.

Projection, spherical clipping, and geodesic interpolation use `d3-geo` (ISC),

are copied into the `.h2kext` bundle under `assets/`. These dependencies are bundled
locally; the map does not load scripts or geography from a remote service.

The default fitted view uses a north-up Natural Earth 1 projection, centered on
the smallest longitude span containing the station and reports. This keeps
continent shapes recognizable across distant reports and handles clusters
crossing the date line. Padding follows the available height as well as width.
Country labels favor equally ranked countries near the station and reports.

The optional azimuthal equidistant view keeps the station in the middle, with
concentric great-circle distance rings. Distances and bearings are accurate
from the station in that view; shapes become more distorted farther from it.
Distance rings appear only in the azimuthal view. Both views draw reception
paths as projected great-circle routes, and the report list uses spherical
distance and bearing calculations independently of the chosen projection.
