# Attribution

The CWT extension is derived from **CWops CWT by Sebastian Delmont, KI2D**, the
main Ham2K developer. The original CWT source is copyright © 2026 Sebastian
Delmont <sd@ham2k.com>, licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. Its
copyright and SPDX notices are retained in the adapted source files.

Changes for N1RWJ add contest call-history data, previous-contact suggestions,
MST, SST, and WRT extensions, an RBN reception panel, shared N1MM and operation-history
adapters, tests, and independent packaging. These are independent extensions;
Ham2K and Sebastian Delmont do not maintain or endorse them.

The adapted CWT source is distributed under MPL-2.0; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
Source and build instructions are available at
[ham2k-n1rwj-extensions](https://github.com/rwjblue/ham2k-n1rwj-extensions).
See [provenance](https://github.com/rwjblue/ham2k-n1rwj-extensions/blob/main/docs/PROVENANCE.md)
for exact upstream sources and the original archive checksum.

The RBN extension and PSK Reporter preview also bundle Natural Earth map data and projection libraries.
See their shared [map attribution](https://github.com/rwjblue/ham2k-n1rwj-extensions/blob/main/packages/reception/assets/MAP_ATTRIBUTION.md)
for sources and licenses. Each reception bundle includes that attribution and the
corresponding library notices under `assets/`.

The bundles include portions of the published `@ham2k/extension-sdk`;
CWT also includes prefill improvements backported from Ham2K/extensions
PR #1. The shared spot-filter contract and its CWT provider are original
MIT-licensed contributions by Robert Jackson. The SDK and build tools are
separately licensed under MIT. The temporary CQ WW extension also retains the official extension’s MIT
license and Sebastian Delmont’s copyright; its complete license is bundled
as `assets/CQWW-LICENSE.md`. Retained MIT notices follow:
